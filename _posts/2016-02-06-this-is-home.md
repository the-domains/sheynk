**_Hello dear internet friend! Welcome to my corner of our connect world._**

**_Things I do:_**

* Next-gen media experience and distribution strategy (platform, vendors, public speaking)
* Organizational design (new departments, integrated vendor/product teams, etc)
* Corporate Development (m&a advisory, partnerships, capital markets, etc)
* Early-stage venture practice development (corp VC programs, deal pipeline development)

**_A bit about me:_**

I am a first generation immigrant (to the US) from Kiev, Ukraine. At the moment I'm helping with hands on operational and board-advisory support for media-oriented startups, international venture eco-system development for the public sector, and having dinners with friends with [TheFlyLabs][0].  

Most recently I was helping Abu Dhabi Media create a new digital product subsidiary, [Advance][1], where I led product management, organizational structuring, vendor management, and new platform integrations in my advisory capacity to the CEO.

Previously I was the Video Technology Product Lead at[VICE Media][2] and Director of Ad-Ventures for [Carrot Creative][3]. I am currently living in Dubai (New York, Prague, Dubai, and Chicago before) and until April 2012 was serving as Director of Corporate Development for [Piksel][4] and a Senior Associate at a Dubai-based [Merchant Bank][5] (more in my [linkedin][6]) focusing on the new media industry (Online Video, Social, Mobile, etc); splitting my time between an office desk, a tray table, and most geeky trade show floors.

At night, I put on a costume and patrol the streets in search of villains. I happen know the layout of most major airports by heart. I have no issue with trying something new and falling flat on my face knowing that I am that much better for having the experience. I love my wife, my awesome friends, ass-kicking mentors, juice boxes, coffee, sneakers and have at least 1000 other vices.
